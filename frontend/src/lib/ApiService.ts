    // Since the POST streams SSE directly, we can't just get a projectId from its JSON response.
    // The EventSource will connect to this same endpoint, which is unusual.
    // A more robust way: POST returns { projectId }, then EventSource connects to GET /api/projects/{id}/stream
    // For now, we will assume the *first meaningful event* on the stream will give us the projectId or we have to infer.
    // This implementation relies on the backend sending a special SSE event or the frontend needing to manage this.
    // The backend `projectRoutes` for POST `/` does `result = await createProject(input);` which gives `projectId`
    // then it calls `processAIResponse(result.projectId)`. The SSE events don't explicitly emit `projectId` back right now.
    // THIS IS A MAJOR HACK/SIMPLIFICATION due to backend POST directly streaming.

    // We need a way to get the projectId. Let's assume it's sent in the first SSE event.
    // Or, we need to modify the backend to send it.
    // For now, we'll have to make a conceptual leap or a temporary workaround.

    // Let's try to read the first chunk of the SSE response from the POST to get the project ID.
    // This is tricky because EventSource API doesn't work this way.
    // The current backend implementation for POST `/api/projects` does NOT return a JSON with projectId.
    // It directly starts streaming. This makes it hard for the client to get the projectId before EventSource.

    // Simplification: Assume we *somehow* get the projectId. In a real app, this needs fixing.
    // We will create the EventSource and hope the context (URL for messages/preview) can be formed.
    // The backend route `POST /api/projects` does create the project and then calls `processAIResponse(result.projectId)`.
    // The SSE events from `onMessage` and `onBuild` in `projectRoutes` do not currently carry the `projectId` explicitly in their structure,
    // though `onBuild` events have it for filtering. The `onMessage` for project creation needs it for saving assistant message.

    // The most straightforward way with the current backend is to use the response from the POST as the SSE stream directly.
    // However, EventSource() constructor takes a URL. It doesn't take a response object.

    // Temporary strategy: We can't easily get projectId from the POST that immediately streams.
    // Let's assume the `createProject` in the backend returns the project object upon non-SSE request,
    // or that the first SSE event contains the projectId.
    // The current `POST /api/projects` is *only* SSE.

    // We'll have to connect the EventSource to the POST endpoint, which is not standard but might work if server supports it for GET-like SSE handshake via POST body.
    // This is highly unlikely to work with the standard EventSource API.

    // A better HACK for now: The client will have to manage this. When the first SSE message with content arrives, it implies the project is created.
    // The UI will need to know this. This is not ideal.
    // Let's just return an EventSource connected to the POST endpoint; this won't work as EventSource expects GET.

    // The current `projectRoutes` on POST `/` establishes SSE. The `projectId` is known *server-side* there.
    // For the client to get it to then make other requests (like preview), it's an issue.

    // Let's assume the frontend navigates to /project/[:pendingProjectId] and then EventSource is established.
    // The backend needs to send back the projectId. The current SSE events from POST /api/projects don't emit `projectId`.
    // I will modify the backend route to emit a `projectCreated` event with the ID.

    // For now, this function will be more of a placeholder showing intent.
    // The actual EventSource setup will be in the component that calls this.
    // This function should ideally make the POST, get a projectId, then return that and the client sets up EventSource.

    // Correcting the conceptual flow:
    // 1. Client POSTs to /api/projects with initialPrompt.
    // 2. Backend creates project, gets projectId.
    // 3. Backend immediately starts streaming SSE *on that POST response*.
    // The client needs to read this stream. EventSource API is for GET.
    // So, this function should return the ReadableStream from response.body.

    const stream = response.body;
    // The calling component will need to process this stream manually.
    // And it needs to extract projectId from the first event.
    // This is too complex for now. Let's stick to the idea of EventSource and fix backend.

    // --- REVISED APPROACH ---
    // I will assume for the frontend that the POST /api/projects returns a JSON { projectId: string }
    // and then the client initiates a separate EventSource to a new GET endpoint for that project's stream.
    // This requires backend changes which I will do after this frontend part.
    // For now, this function will *simulate* this ideal flow.
