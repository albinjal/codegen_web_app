# Implementation Nudge
- To distinguish between this project and projects generated by the codegen web app we call those project user_generated_project.
- We keep track of project_id in the database and use this to reference the project.
- I have access to a a template user_generated_project. When a project is created we start by copying the template to a directory identified by the project_id.
- We run initial setup of the project with npm install and then expose/serve it to the web client on a speicifc location
- A user prompt might cause one or more code edits. When the code edits are done, we should automatically rebuild the project and update the preview website.
- Make sure to give the model clear context in order to make the correct edits. You can use XML tags to structure the interaction.
- Use the Antropic Typescript SDK.
- Define the model in one place so it can be changed easily.
- Use SSE to stream the chat response to the web client.
- Use as few api endpoints and data types as possible.
