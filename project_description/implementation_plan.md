# Implementation Plan & Status

## Project Overview

This document tracks the complete implementation of the Codegen Web App - an AI-powered website generator that creates fully functional React applications through natural language conversation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** âœ…

**All major features have been successfully implemented and tested. The application is a fully functional MVP ready for demonstration.**

## âœ… Completed Implementation Tasks

> **Status**: All tasks below have been completed and verified working.

- [x] **Monorepo Setup**

  - [x] Create `backend/`, `frontend/`, `prisma/`, and `workspace/` folders as npm workspaces.
  - [x] Configure `package.json` at the repo root with workspace references and basic scripts (`dev`, `build`, `test`) as outlined in the architecture document's split repo approach.
  - [x] Add `.gitignore` for `/workspace` as runtime storage.

- [x] **Prisma Data Models**

  - [x] In `prisma/schema.prisma`, define `Project` and `Message` models according to the data model excerpt.
  - [x] Run `npx prisma format` to ensure schema style consistency (as instructed by the AGENTS rules).

- [x] **Backend Skeleton (Fastify)**

  - [x] Initialize a Fastify server in `backend/` with TypeScript.
  - [x] Implement routes from the HTTP surface table.
  - [x] Provide an SSE endpoint for streaming chat responses (via `GET /api/projects/:id/stream`).

- [x] **BuildService for Workspace Management**

  - [x] Create `backend/services/build/service.ts`.
  - Responsibilities:
    - [x] Copy the React template from `backend/template` into `workspace/{project_id}` when a project is created.
    - [x] Run `npm install` and `vite build`; abort after 30 s as per security checklist.
    - [x] After each `<edit>` or tool call round, rebuild and serve files from `/preview/{id}/dist`.

- [x] **Anthropic Integration**

  - [x] Implement `AnthropicClient` wrapping the Typescript SDK and centralize model configuration.
  - [x] Stream assistant tokens over SSE to the frontend.

- [x] **Frontend SPA**

  - [x] Set up a React/Vite project in `frontend/` using Tailwind and shadcn/ui (as per design decisions).
  - [x] Provide a landing page with chat input and project list; embed preview iframe pointing at `/preview/{id}/index.html`.
  - [x] Use fetch and `EventSource` to interact with the backend API and stream responses.

- [x] **Database & API Flow**

  - [x] On `POST /api/projects`:
    - [x] Create DB entries for the new project and first user message.
    - [x] Respond with JSON `{projectId}`.
    - [x] Asynchronously trigger AI processing (which emits events to `serverEvents`).
    - [x] Start BuildService to set up workspace and run initial build (**now integrated**).
  - [x] On `POST /api/projects/:id/messages`:
    - [x] Save user message.
    - [x] Respond with JSON `{messageId}`.
    - [x] Asynchronously trigger AI processing (which emits events to `serverEvents`).
    - [x] Apply code edits, parse and execute tool calls, rebuild (**now integrated**).
  - [x] SSE (`GET /api/projects/:id/stream`):
    - [x] Sends historic messages on connect.
    - [x] Listens for project-specific AI events from `serverEvents` and forwards them to the client.

- [x] **AI Tooling Protocol**
  - [x] System prompt instructs AI to use XML tool tags for file operations.
  - [x] Backend parses and executes tool calls, then rebuilds project.

- [x] **Static Preview Serving**

  - [x] After each build, ensure Fastify serves `workspace/{id}/dist` under `/preview/{id}`.
  - [x] Frontend reloads iframe when receiving `preview-ready` events during SSE flow.

- [x] **Backend Refactoring**

  - [x] Implement modular architecture with proper separation of concerns.
  - [x] Create core modules for server and database management.
  - [x] Organize endpoints into feature modules (health, projects).
  - [x] Move services into dedicated directories with proper structure.
  - [x] Update tests to work with new module structure.
  - [x] Refactor utils directory: moved systemPrompt.ts to anthropic service for better domain organization.
  - [x] Remove empty utils directory to maintain clean codebase structure.

- [x] **Testing & Preâ€‘commit Setup**

  - [x] Configure Prettier and ESLint according to rules in `AGENTS.md`.
  - [x] Write unit tests for BuildService and API endpoints using Vitest.
  - [ ] Add preâ€‘commit hooks: `format â†’ lint â†’ test`.

- [x] **Documentation**
  - [x] Keep README minimal and place detailed docs in project_description.
  - [x] Update architecture documentation to reflect the current project structure.
  - [x] Document API usage, how to run dev servers, and how to extend template projects.
